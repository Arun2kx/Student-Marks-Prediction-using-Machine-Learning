# Student Marks Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the **final marks of a student** based on study-related features such as study hours, attendance, previous scores, and other academic parameters.

The main idea is to help colleges, teachers, and institutions **identify weak students early** and provide the right support before exams.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Many students struggle to score well because they do not realize how much preparation they need.  
Using machine learning, we can predict student performance and guide them to improve.

This project builds a **regression model** that predicts student marks based on past learning patterns.

### What the model learns:
- How study hours affect marks  
- How attendance impacts performance  
- Importance of previous test scores  
- How combined factors influence results

## 🧠 Key Features

### ✔ 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed missing values  
- Normalized features  
- Handled categorical values (if any)

### ✔ 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation heatmaps  
- Scatter plots (Study hours vs Marks)  
- Distribution plots  

### ✔ 3. Model Building
Used **Linear Regression** as the primary model.  
(Simple, interpretable, accurate for this dataset)

### ✔ 4. Model Evaluation
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- R² Score  
- Train/Test split validation  

### ✔ 5. Prediction
Given input values (e.g., study hours), the model predicts expected marks.
